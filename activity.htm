			<h2>What we did in HACKATHON 2019?</h2>
			<p style="margin:10px auto 60px auto">We had the same mind and wanted to create something new so we were here. Our idea for this contest was to create a new navigation system for the blind. It also makes it easier and more intelligent for them to get around without relying on blind sticks. In this way, this system came out in our minds, and we called it OWL, which could use in wearable devices，such as glasses. We split it into three core parts. The first part is the object recognition, which was able to tell what objects were around. The second part is the direction identification, which was able to identify directions for the user, and the distance between the object and user. The last part was voice output，which to transmit information to the user in the form of sound. </p>

			<h2>Deep Learning Team</h2>
			<p style="margin:10px auto 60px auto">I joined Dr. Tang's Deep Learning Team in September 2019, which mainly engaged in research on the field of image recognition. During this period, I primarily focus on Neural Networks and Convolutional Networks, optimizations, and the construction of the model. </p>
